### Last week

- We saw a brief history of experimental methods and their main characteristics
  - Key milestones from Petrarch (1394) to modern RCTs, including James Lind's scurvy experiment and the first psychological experiments by Pierce
- We also saw the main types of experiments
  - Lab experiments, field experiments, and natural experiments
  - We discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each type
- Finally, we briefly discussed the distinction between correlation and causation
- Key tools: R/Python, GitHub, Quarto, and Jupyter Notebooks
- Assignments: Problem sets (50%), pre-analysis plan (20%), and final project (30%), with a late policy and collaboration guidelines
