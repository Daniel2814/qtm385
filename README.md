# QTM 385 - Experimental Methods

## Course Description

Welcome to [QTM 385](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm385)! This course introduces the principles of experimental design, focusing on the design and analysis of experiments in the social and life sciences. We will cover the basics of probability theory, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference, as well as the design of experiments and surveys. You will learn how to use statistical software to analyse data and interpret results, and how to communicate your findings effectively. We will also discuss ethical issues in experimental research and the importance of transparency and reproducibility in scientific work. Throughout the course, you will develop the skills needed to design and conduct your experiments and surveys and evaluate the work of others.

2. Develop comprehensive pre-analysis plans (PAPs) for experimental research, demonstrating an understanding of best practices in pre-registration.
3. Apply statistical techniques to analyse experimental data.
4. Use Quarto to create reproducible research documents and presentations.
5. Critically evaluate experimental designs and results, identifying potential issues and limitations.
6. Adapt analysis strategies to address unexpected challenges in experimental data.
7. Understand and apply ethical considerations in experimental design and analysis.
8. Develop problem-solving skills through regular problem sets covering various aspects of experimental design and analysis.
