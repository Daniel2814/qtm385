# Lecture 01: Introduction

This folder contains the slides used in our first lecture. The slides are available at <https://raw.githack.com/danilofreire/qtm385/main/lectures/lecture-01/01-introduction.html>.

I would like to acknowledge [Thomas Leeper](https://github.com/leeper/expcourse/tree/gh-pages), [Saloni Dattani](https://ourworldindata.org/randomized-controlled-trials), and [Denis Cohen](https://github.com/socialsciencedatalab/potential-outcomes) for sharing their work, which the lecture slides were partially based on. Thank you!
