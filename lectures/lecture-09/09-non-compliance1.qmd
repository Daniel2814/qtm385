### Trabalho pra esta semana

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}

- Please send me an email (<danilo.freire@emory.edu>) by Wednesday with the following content:
  - Two paragraphs (maximum) summarising an experiment that you wish to develop in this course. At a minimum, your summary should include a research question, why the question is important, and a rough outline of how you plan to answer the question.

- We’ll be working on a little bit of the task each week during class, and I’ll be posting the week’s assignments on the website. It will be fun! 😊
