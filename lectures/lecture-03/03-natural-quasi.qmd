# Hello, everyone! üëã <br> Hope you're all doing well! üòâ {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Last time, we saw that...

:::{.column width=50%}

- A good research question should produce [knowledge that solves real-world problems]{.alert} and guides policy decisions, with a [practical and credible research design]{.alert}

- [Theory]{.alert} is essential in research design, whether implicit or explicit, as it helps generate hypotheses, informs design choices, and guides inference strategies

- [Operationalisation]{.alert} is the process of translating theoretical concepts into measurable variables, such as turning "social isolation" into the frequency of social interactions

- [Pre-registration]{.alert} involves filing research designs and hypotheses publicly to reduce bias, improve credibility, and distinguish between pre-planned and exploratory analyses

- The [reproducibility crisis]{.alert} in science highlights the need for transparent and replicable research, with pre-registration and pre-analysis plans helping address this issue

:::{.column width=50%}

- The [EGAP research design form](https://egap.github.io/learningdays-resources/Exercises/design-form.html) provides a blueprint for creating robust research designs, covering key components like hypotheses, population, intervention, outcomes, and analysis

- The [MIDA framework](https://book.declaredesign.org/introduction/what-is-a-research-design.html#mida-the-four-elements-of-a-research-design) (Model, Inquiry, Data, Answer) helps researchers simulate and diagnose their designs before implementation, ensuring they can answer their research questions effectively

- [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/) is a tool that allows researchers to declare, diagnose, and design their studies using the MIDA framework, improving the quality and credibility of research

- A [two-arm trial]{.alert} is a common experimental design where units are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups, and the average treatment effect (ATE) is estimated

- [Alignment]{.alert} between research design and theoretical frameworks is necessary for generating credible and actionable results, even when experiments are not feasible

## Today, we will discuss...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [The experimental ideal]{.alert}: why we should keep it in mind even when we use observational data
- [Natural experiments]{.alert}: what they are and how they can help us estimate causal effects
- [Quasi-experiments]{.alert}: how they differ from natural experiments and the challenges they pose
- The [quasi-experimental toolkit]{.alert}: 
  - Matching
  - Instrumental variables
  - Regression discontinuity
  - Difference-in-differences
- [Internal and external validity]{.alert}: the trade-offs between them
- [Cumuative knowledge]{.alert}: how different research designs contribute to it

# The experimental ideal üßëüèª‚Äçüî¨ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## A benchmark for causal inference

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- You already know by now that [the most credible way to estimate causal effects]{.alert} is through randomised experiments
- This is because experiments [address confounding]{.alert} by randomly assigning units to treatment and control groups
  - By confounding, we mean the presence of unobserved variables ($Z$) that affect both the treatment and the outcome
- This means that:
  - All covariates are balanced between treatment and control groups
  - The treatment is independent of potential outcomes (more on that in the next lecture)
- Today, we will investigate this ideal a little further, and see how we can get closer to it even when we don't have experimental data
- But first, let's see an example
